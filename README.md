#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Objective
In this repository, I'm charting my progress as I learn Tableau for data analysis. Starting from the basics and advancing to complex data visualization and analysis methods, my end goal is to prepare for the [Tableau Data Analyst Certification](https://www.tableau.com/learn/certification/certified-data-analyst) while enhancing my skills in data handling, advanced calculation methods and statistical methods.
