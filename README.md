#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Objective
This repository documents my progress through the Data Analyst Professional Certification at DataCamp, with a focus on Python. The certification involves two timed exams and a practical exam. During my preparation, I've had the opportunity to enhance my Python skills, covering everything from basic concepts to advanced data wrangling and manipulation techniques. I've also learned to create charts and graphs using popular visualization packages.

As of December 2023, I have passed all exams and currently hold the Certified Data Analyst Professional credential.

## Sales methods strategic analysis

The stationery products market, characterized by intense competition and evolving consumer preferences, presents both challenges and opportunities for 'Pens and Printers.' In response to the launch of their new product line, this report delves into a comprehensive analysis of sales data over the initial six-week period. My objective was to thoroughly analyze and understand the impact of various sales strategies on market penetration and revenue generation. The approach involved rigorous validation and cleaning of the data, followed by an exploratory analysis to identify patterns, trends, and financial implications of each sales method. This report details my methodological journey, paving the way for the comprehensive findings and strategic insights I've included in my written report and shared with the sales representative in an online video presentation.
